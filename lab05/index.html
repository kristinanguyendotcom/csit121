            <p>There has been a lot to learn in such little time already, but it is exciting 
            to get to know this language thoroughly and see how the Web works.
            I have learned the way of transporting information quickly, and how fast it has improved
            throughout the years. I have learned how to set up a repository in Github as well as know the importance of details 
            in links, as it is literally a file pathway. And now here I am, making my own HTML site! I am excited to learn more 
            skills soon.</p>
    <h3 id="blog2">Created September 20th, 2024</h3>
            <p>Through completing this assignment, I have learned how to customize
                my HTML page through colors, alignments, fonts, and borders! I had some 
                trouble with getting ID and class selectors to work as I didn't quite understand it
                from W3schools, but I googled and found a post on Reddit that 
                helped explain it to me more easily. I also used MDNwebdocs and W3schools 
                a lot to help me figure out borders, especially with how to change link colors. 
                And finally, I had to turn to Google to see examples of how stylesheets were supposed to
                look to make sure I wasn't messing up. But through this research, I'm 
                fairly happy with what I've created, and am still excited to improve more.</p>
    <h3 id="blog3">Created October 20th, 2024</h3>
            <p>This lab felt a little easier to grasp with the examples that were given out in smaller doses 
                for easier congestion. I found after practice, some best practices would include creating media queiries 
                to make a page responsive and adaptable for all users. This is done by setting a minimum or maximum width,
                and creating special elements within those queiries that would change. I also found that another beneficial 
                practice is breaking your information into sections so it is easier to map out the layout to your HTML. Once I 
                did that, it was easier to thinkbout using flexbox or grid to organize and present the information.
