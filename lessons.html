            <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>

            <br>
            
            <p>There have been a lot of lessons that were learned throughout this project and semester.
                I found that putting together this final project was not as hard as I anticipated because of all the skills learned throughout the course. 
                I did have challenges when it came to using the media query, creating the table, and the interactivity between pages. When I ran into these problems,
                I was able to go back to those previous labs and refer to the work I did there to remind me. And if I couldn't find my work, I knew to research similiar topics on the internet
                to see what other programmers have done. When I did remember how to do things from memory,
                I felt like I had actually learned and practived the skill enough to have a working knowledge.               
            </p>

            <p>When I tested this project on multiple browsers and devices, I found that it was a seamless transition from one to another. I tested my website using Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome, as well as my iPhone device.
                When going through all the tabs for my webpage, I wanted to make sure that the text, images, and table were formatted correctly to create a more appeasing look.
                I found that having a consistent and versatile header contributed to especially good design to create a positive user experience no matter how or where they are accessing the site.
            </p>

            <p>Compared to where I was at the beginning of the semester, I now know a lot more about web standards than if I have ever learned on my own. 
                This was through the rigorous structure and schedule of the class, that pushed me to learn these concepts 
                in a short amount of time to really compile the standards and skills I've learned. I wish I had put more time towards this course throughout the semester but 
                when learning web standards for the first time, I did find it challenging and an uphill battle. But through it, I learned a lot!</p>
