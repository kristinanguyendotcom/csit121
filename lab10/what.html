        <h3>What is Indexed Database API?</h3>
        <p>Indexed Database API is an application prograsmming interface (API) that uses an index to store complex data such objects, files and more. The index is unique because it is a specialized, and persistent storage of key-value pairs!</p>

        <p>Indexed DB is not too different than using keys or SQL, but it takes those lists, and combines them together into a tree. This makes the B-Tree information structure that makes up indexed DB.</p>
        
        <p>The B-Tree signifies a database, and how each database contains object stores, or lists, and has a set amount of them. Meaning, it is capable of holding large amounts of data on our user end without using too much spcae at all.</p>
