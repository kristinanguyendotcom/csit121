    <p>Does anyone need a good reason to like Hallo Kitty, especially for Halloween?</p>

    <p>Such a cute and festive way to feel spooky!</p>

    <p>This hello kitty image is a .jpg, which is a comfortable middle between .png and .gif as the size for this sits right in the middle of the two at 121KB.</p>

    <p>I am also impressed it has lots of detail for half the size of the gif.</p>
